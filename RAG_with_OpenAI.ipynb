              " Document(page_content='Electric power sector weighs promising \\ntrends amid cost and climate woes\\n2022 was a year of perils and promise for the electric power sector. US electricity sales continued \\nto rise as the pandemic recovery progressed, increasing 3.6% in the first eight months compared to \\nthe prior year.1 But costs also spiked, largely due to natural gas prices more than doubling on global \\nshortages exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Coal prices also rose as demand surged for \\nalternatives to gas,2 while renewable energy prices followed suit due to supply chain disruption, \\ninflation, and rising interest rates.3 As a result, US retail electricity prices reached record highs in \\n2022, averaging 12.3 cents per kilowatt hour (cts/kWh) across all segments (commercial, industrial, \\nresidential) in the first eight months, up 11% year over year.4 And they’re expected to remain elevated \\ninto 2023.  \\nExtreme climate events—from droughts to hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires—continued to test \\nregional grid resilience.5 In response, the industry and policymakers worked to bolster reserves, \\ndeploy energy storage and microgrids, harden infrastructure, and strengthen flexible load options.6 \\nThe power sector also boosted efforts to thwart increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats.7\\n \\nAt the same time, 2022 brought several promising developments that will likely carry forward into \\n2023:  \\n• US renewable generation and capacity rose, accounting for over 23% of electricity generated from \\nJanuary through August 2022, up from about 21% in the same period of 2021.8 Solar and wind \\npower accounted for 69% of new utility-scale capacity additions from January to August 2022.9 \\n• The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extended and expanded tax credits for renewables, electric \\nvehicles, stand-alone storage, green hydrogen, clean energy manufactured components, and \\nmore.10 \\n• Funds began to flow from the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known \\nas the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to support grid modernization and clean energy research \\nand deployment.11 \\n• Regional transmission organizations submitted initial plans for distributed energy resources (DER) \\nto participate in wholesale markets under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 2222.12 \\n• US electric vehicle sales may have approached a tipping point, rising to 6.3% of light-duty vehicle \\nsales in H1 2022.13 \\nIn 2023, these promising developments will likely evolve further. But providing secure, reliable, \\naffordable, and clean electricity could become even more challenging. Inflation, high fuel costs, and \\nsupply chain snarls may keep electricity prices elevated, while extreme weather, cybersecurity threats, \\nand the growth of variable renewables and DER may continue to require innovative management \\nto ensure grid reliability. The 47 largest US electric and gas utilities plan to spend a record-breaking \\n$169.4 billion in 2023 to enhance reliability, security, and renewable integration.14 But as customers \\nstruggle with bill increases, affordability could become elusive.\\nDespite these challenges, new technologies and supportive policies could ripen opportunities in \\n2023 and help the industry achieve its goals. We explore several of these promising trends and \\ntheir potential impact on the industry in this year’s outlook, as well as what 2023 may hold for \\nenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures.\\n2023 power and utilities industry outlook\\n3', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/us-eri-power-utilities-outlook-2023.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Utilities increasingly plan to roll out the next wave of advanced metering \\ninfrastructure (AMI)\\nMany of the more than 115 million “smart” electricity meters \\ndeployed at US customer sites since 2000 are beginning to show \\ntheir age, and utilities are increasingly developing replacement \\nplans.15 After a 15–20 year life span, batteries are wearing out and \\nsome need to be replaced. This first generation of digital electricity \\nmeters displaced mechanical meters and, for the first time, enabled \\nutilities to remotely read their entire population of meters in daily, \\nhourly, or even 15-minute intervals.16 Utilities could remotely \\nreceive power quality information, switch power on and off, and \\ndetect power outages immediately.\\nSmart meters have saved utilities significant time and money \\nand enabled carbon emissions reduction through fewer truck \\nrolls to read, activate, and deactivate meters. One analysis found \\nthat operational savings for deployments greater than 500,000 \\nmeters averaged $10 per meter per year, recovering 65% to \\n75% of the initial cost of the meter deployment program over 20 \\nyears.17 Utility benefits came largely from reducing meter readers, \\ndeferring generation investment, detecting theft, and implementing \\nconservation voltage reduction (CVR).18 Some consumers benefitted \\nfrom online move-in/move-out scheduling, outage restoration time \\nnotifications, dynamic pricing plans, and bill forecasting alerts.\\nThe first wave of smart meters had a life expectancy of \\napproximately 20 years, which appears roughly accurate based on \\ninterviews with AMI 1.0-enabled utilities.19 As AMI systems approach \\nthat age, some utilities will start planning their replacement in 2023, \\nas a large replacement project can take three to five years to plan \\nand supply chain kinks could delay it further. Utility companies \\ntypically replace the entire meter rather than just the batteries \\nbecause many meters are sealed or require disassembly, making \\nbattery-only replacement impractical.20 And, just as first-wave AMI \\nbenefits helped pay for implementation, the benefits of next-gen \\nAMI (or AMI 2.0) could also help justify the rollout expense.AMI 2.0 features faster processors, more memory, modular \\ncommunication capabilities, and longer-lasting batteries.21 \\nResidential meters are becoming edge computing devices that can \\nbetter understand how electricity is being used or generated behind \\nthe meter. And that could be increasingly important as consumers \\nadd solar panels, electric vehicles, or battery storage and seek to \\ninteract with the grid. Fifty-three percent of our survey respondents \\nsaid the most important capability AMI 2.0 could provide would be \\nto support utility flexible load programs with real-time, device level \\nusage analysis.

Proposed rules by the US \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could provide further \\nmomentum in 2023.\\nCurrently, most utilities post ESG reports and other sustainability \\nactivities on their websites. For many, it’s their version of a \\ncomprehensive Sustainability Report or Corporate Responsibility \\nReport, which includes all aspects of ESG, not just environmental \\nand climate.22 These reports tend to describe activities of the \\ncompany, aspirational commitments made, and progress toward \\nidentified ESG metrics. Reporting often includes elements of the \\ncompany’s compliance with frameworks such as the Greenhouse \\nGas Protocol, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures (TCFD), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board \\n(SASB), and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).23 Nearly all utilities \\npopulate an ESG template developed by the Edison Electric Institute \\nand the American Gas Association and their member companies \\nspecifically for power and gas utilities, and include it in reports or \\npost it on their websites.24 Many also submit disclosures through \\nthe Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) portal.25\\nEnhanced ESG reporting and decarbonization commitments will \\nlikely progress further in 2023, as companies see a growing need \\nto identify rapidly changing environmental and societal disrupters \\nand address them. Mounting calls for more disclosures on how the \\ncompanies are prepared to deal with disrupters are another driver. \\nFigure 2 illustrates how ESG is an integral part of business planning. \\nFigure 2. ESG is increasingly integral to business planning\\nSource: Deloitte analysis.For most large power companies, the reports outline their carbon \\nemissions reduction goals and plans to achieve them. As of October \\n2022, 43 of the 45 largest investor-owned utilities had committed \\nto reducing carbon emissions.26 Each year more companies \\nannounce targets or strengthen existing targets. Regulators, \\ninvestors, customers, and other stakeholders continue to urge more \\ncomprehensive, consistent, and standardized ESG reporting. And \\nreports suggest that favorable ESG ratings can boost a company’s \\naccess to sustainability-linked financing, such as green bonds, and \\nlower their cost of capital.27\\nCurrently, US company disclosures and metrics are not uniform \\nand third-party review or assurance is not widespread.

Power and utility companies are considering \\nwhich options make the most economic sense in the near term.45\\nThe IRA provides a new tax credit for qualified “clean hydrogen” facilities, where hydrogen is produced through a process that results in \\na lifecycle GHG emissions rate not exceeding 4 kilograms (kg) of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen.46 The tax credit \\nvaries depending on the lifecycle GHG emissions rate, with the full $3/kg typically applying to hydrogen produced through renewable- or \\nnuclear-powered electrolysis.47\\nThe power and utilities sector has typically produced and consumed a negligible share of hydrogen, but that could begin to change in \\n2023.48 Power companies are evaluating hydrogen options with an eye to those most immediately economically feasible. Producing clean \\nhydrogen using renewable or nuclear generation is often an attractive option. And it could potentially qualify for at least two IRA tax credits: \\nan ITC or a PTC for the renewable or nuclear generation, and a credit for the hydrogen production.49 Below are five ways some power \\ncompanies are considering monetizing clean hydrogen’s value, and figure 4 provides perspectives from our industry survey:  \\n• Sell it to industrial or transportation sector consumers. Site electrolyzers near consumers (such as oil refiners and ammonia \\nproducers) that already use conventional hydrogen and don’t require new infrastructure.50 Proceeds can help power companies \\nexpand renewables and support nuclear plants.  \\n• Store and use it as long-duration energy storage. Hydrogen could be a way to “store” excess wind and solar output longer than the \\ntypical four- or eight-hour battery system allows.51 Stored hydrogen could fuel power plants when wind and solar are offline. However, \\nthis could require new storage facilities and gas turbines that can run on 100% hydrogen or hydrogen blends.  \\n• Provide flexible distributed generation through hydrogen fuel cells, which could power industrial and commercial end users, \\nhelp balance load, provide resiliency, and mitigate renewable variability. Fuel cells could also qualify for an ITC.  \\n• Use it to help decarbonize their own natural gas distribution systems, or sell it to other gas utilities. Levels above a 5 to 15% \\nblend with natural gas could require significant upgrades to distribution infrastructure and end-user appliances.52 \\n• Use it for baseload power generation. Economics are currently challenging at the scale needed, though new gas-fired generation \\nwill likely be built with the capacity to use increasing amounts of hydrogen in the future.53 \\n \\nFigure 4.

States with ZEV and clean car standards\\nSource: California Air Resources Board,”States that have Adopted California’s Vehicle Standards under Section 177 of the Federal Clean Air Act,” May 13, 2022.\\nSome of the thorniest challenges to meeting these goals could be for the auto and battery industries to produce enough EVs and batteries, \\ngiven supply chain constraints and IRA tax credit eligibility requirements for EVs.59 Surveyed power and utilities executives perceive their \\nsector’s key priorities as supporting charging infrastructure buildout (43%); upgrading distribution assets to prepare for increased load \\n(36%); and preparing to manage new load with EV rates to encourage off-peak charging (18%).60 Below are some important focus areas for \\n2023 and beyond:  \\n •  Vehicle-grid integration: While US electricity generation is generally deemed sufficient to handle the roughly 2% annual demand \\ngrowth expected from EVs,61 spreading out demand over time and upgrading distribution system equipment in high-adoption areas is \\na priority. Utilities are increasingly setting rates that encourage off-peak charging—and new submetering technology enables them to \\ncharge separate rates without installing additional meters.62 Some utilities will use accumulated data to fine-tune managed charging \\nprograms. And while widespread adoption of bidirectional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies may still be several years off, pilot activity \\nis largely focusing on fleet V2G programs and vehicle-to-home charging.63 \\n •  Charging infrastructure buildout: All 50 states have submitted EV infrastructure deployment plans to access the IIJA’s $5 billion \\nallocation for 500,000 fast-charging stations across 53,000 miles over five years.64 And many utilities will be providing the additional \\nequipment upgrades, or “make readies,” to prepare sites for charger installation. Since fast chargers require a significant amount \\nof power, utilities are gearing up to provide extra infrastructure such as conduit, trenching, cabling, and switchgear, including new \\ntransformers and meters (much of which still faces supply chain constraints). Many utilities are also coordinating with fleet operators to \\nsupport charging infrastructure for trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles.  \\n• Medium- and heavy-duty vehicle uptake: Nearly 20 states and jurisdictions are aiming for 30% of new medium- and heavy-duty \\n(MDHD) vehicle sales to be electric by 2030, and 100% by 2050.65 2021–2022 saw unprecedented MDHD growth in investment, policy \\nsupport, and deployment,66 and utilities are increasingly offering programs to promote and enable MDHD vehicle uptake. This includes \\npiloting several electric school bus V2G programs. Adoption is likely to accelerate further in 2023 with IIJA investments, such as $5 \\nbillion for electric school buses and $5.6 billion for electric transit buses.

For\\xa0instance, \\nsometimes a\\xa0lack of security awareness \\nwithin the organization can inadvertently \\nexpose systems to cyber attacks, such \\nas when employees bring portable \\nmedia that is infected with malware into \\nthe environment. Furthermore,\\xa0many \\noperations employees simply believe \\ntheir systems are an unlikely target, thus \\nthey are reluctant to buy into the need to \\nchange their behaviors and implement new \\nsecurity protocols. After\\xa0all, not long ago \\nthey could safely assume all equipment \\ncomponents were trustworthy, which is \\nno longer the case since digital sensors \\nand controllers can be manipulated to \\nprovide false input and misguiding status \\ninformation.

              " Document(page_content='July 2014\\nReal estate sector\\nClearly IFRS\\nIndustry insights for IFRS 15\\nNew revenue Standard could have a major impact on profile \\nof revenue and profit recognition\\nWhat’s happened?\\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has published a \\nnew Standard, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (‘the new Standard’). The new Standard outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, which is found currently across several Standards and Interpretations within IFRSs. The core principle is that an entity recognises revenue to reflect the transfer of goods or services, measured as the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. However, the new Standard does not apply to transactions that are instead within the scope of the leasing standard.\\nThe new Standard is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, with earlier application permitted. Entities can choose to apply the Standard retrospectively or use a modified approach in the year of application. It is the result of a convergence project with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that began in 2002. Almost fully converged, the most significant differences between IFRSs and US GAAP relate to interim disclosures and timing of adoption. \\nImplications for the real estate sector\\nBelow, we highlight certain key impacts resulting from the new Standard that will be of particular interest to those in the real estate sector and then consider parts of the new Standard that may contribute to those impacts. Of course many more complexities exist and, as described below, Deloitte has produced further guidance which explores these in greater detail.\\nHow might this affect you?\\nThe timing of revenue and profit recognition may be significantly \\naffected by the new Standard\\nWhereas previously IFRSs allowed significant room for judgement in \\ndevising and applying revenue recognition policies and practices,  IFRS 15 is more prescriptive in many areas relevant to the real estate sector. Applying these new rules may result in significant changes to the profile of revenue and, in some cases, cost recognition. This is not merely a financial reporting issue. As well as preparing the market and educating analysts on the impact of the new Standard, entities will need to consider wider implications. Amongst others, these might include:\\n•\\tchanges to key performance indicators and other key metrics;\\n•\\tchanges to the profile of tax cash payments;\\n•\\tavailability of profits for distribution;\\n•\\tfor compensation and bonus plans, impact on the timing of targets \\nbeing achieved and the likelihood of targets being met; and\\n•\\tpotential non-compliance with loan covenants.\\nHeadlines\\nThe profile of revenue and profit recognition will change for some \\nentities as the new Standard is more detailed and more prescriptive than the existing guidance and introduces new complexities. In particular, real estate companies will need to consider:\\n•\\twhether revenue should be recognised over time or at a point in time;\\n•\\tthe extent to which distinct goods or services are supplied, which \\nshould be accounted for separately;\\n•\\twhether particular costs relating to obtaining a contract must be capitalised;\\n•\\twhether revenue must be adjusted for the effects of the time value of money;\\n•\\thow to account for contract modifications; and\\n•\\tthe impact of new guidance where pricing mechanisms include \\nvariable amounts.\\nThe new Standard requires significantly more disclosures relating to revenue and entities will need to ensure that appropriate processes are in place to gather the information.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/ca-en-audit-ifrs15-realestate.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Real estate sector Clearly IFRS Industry insights for IFRS 15Current accounting processes may require changes to \\ncope with the new Standard\\nAs explained below, IFRS 15 introduces new requirements \\nto move to a more conceptual approach. The complexity of applying this approach and of producing the detailed disclosures required by the new Standard in the real estate sector may require modifications to existing accounting systems and, in some cases, entities may conclude that they should develop new systems processes. Entities should ensure they allow sufficient time to develop and implement any required modifications to processes.\\nWhat are the most \\nsignificant changes?\\nProperty developers and construction companies\\nShould revenue be recognised over time or at a point \\nin time?\\nIFRS 15 introduces a new approach to determine whether \\nrevenue should be recognised over time or at a point in time. Three scenarios are specified in which revenue will be recognised over time – broadly, they are when (i) the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the seller’s performance as the seller performs; (ii) the seller is creating a ‘work in progress’ asset which is controlled by the customer; and (iii) the seller is creating a ‘work in progress’ asset which could not be directed to a different customer and in respect of which the customer has an obligation to pay for the entity’s work to date. If revenue is to be recognised over time, a method should be used which best reflects the pattern of transfer of goods or services to the customer. If a transaction does not fit into any of the three scenarios described above, revenue will instead be recognised at a point in time, when control passes to the customer.\\nThis guidance is different from, and much more specific than, that previously included in IFRSs, and some entities may find that revenue previously recognised at a point in time should now be recognised over time, or vice versa. For example, revenue from an off- plan sale of real estate may be affected by the new Standard. Whether revenue should be recognised over time or at a point in time will often depend on a careful analysis of specific contract terms. Quite small differences between otherwise similar contracts could potentially have a fundamental impact on the timing of revenue recognition. In determining whether revenue on such sales is recognised at a point in time or over time, particular care will need to be given to whether the entity could have an alternative use for the asset under construction and the entitlement of the entity to be paid for the work performed to date. It will often be particularly important to focus on any contractual terms allowing the customer to cancel, curtail or significantly modify the contract and whether, if such circumstances arose, the seller would always be contractually entitled to adequate compensation for work performed to date. Assessment of these factors, and others, will need to be made in the context of both the contract terms and the local legal environment.\\nWhere an entity concludes that revenue should be recognised over time, it will need to consider how to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations. IFRS 15 specifies that the measure of progress shall exclude any goods or services for which the entity does not transfer control to the customer. As such, the measure of progress (and therefore the percentage of revenue to be recognised) may be affected by whether or not control of the land on which the property is being constructed is transferred to the buyer (and the timing of that transfer).\\nHow to identify and allocate revenue to different \\ngoods and services\\nPreviously, given the lack of specific guidance in IFRSs, there \\nwas greater room for judgement when identifying the distinct goods and services within a contract. Entities may have to amend their current accounting policies as a result of the more detailed guidance in IFRS 15 and, in particular, the new rules on how revenue is allocated between different items. Construction companies often have multi-element contracts and IFRS 15 may affect the determination of whether certain elements of a contract are recognised separately, which may have a significant impact on the profile of revenue recognition. \\nFor example, the new Standard may affect whether a parcel of land that is sold as part of a contract for the construction of a building is considered to constitute a distinct good to be accounted for separately. It may also affect the identification of separate service obligations (and the timing of recognition of the related revenue) included in a construction contract covering the design, construction, and operation phases of a real estate project. For example, should the services performed as part of the design phase be accounted for separately (because, for example, the developer frequently sells these services separately) or are they not distinct from the construction and/or operation phases of the contract?', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/ca-en-audit-ifrs15-realestate.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Real estate sector Clearly IFRS Industry insights for IFRS 15Should contract costs be capitalised?\\nIn addition to more prescriptive guidance on revenue recognition, \\nthe new Standard introduces specific criteria for determining whether to capitalise certain costs, distinguishing between those costs associated with obtaining a contract (e.g. sales commissions) and those costs associated with fulfilling a contract. This becomes an issue for construction companies where significant costs are incurred that are directly attributable to obtaining contracts with customers, for example, bid costs incurred prior to a contract being awarded. These may include costs related to fulfilling a contract or costs of obtaining a contract and accounting treatment will be dependent on the nature (or type) of costs incurred. For example, design costs which qualify as a cost of fulfilling a contract will generally be capitalised if they meet certain criteria, including an expectation that the costs will be recovered, whereas costs of obtaining a contract prior to the contract being awarded, such as legal costs, will usually be expensed as they are costs that will have been incurred whether or not the contract is obtained. In contrast to this, ‘success fees’ (i.e. commissions that are only payable if a contract is obtained) will be capitalised under the new Standard as they are incremental costs of obtaining a contract. At present, different entities might treat various types of cost differently so there may be an impact on operating profits. \\nThe new Standard requires capitalised contract costs to be amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of the goods or services. Entities will need to exercise judgement to determine the appropriate basis and time period for this amortisation.\\nShould revenue be adjusted for the effects of the time \\nvalue of money?\\nIFRS 15 introduces new and more extensive guidance on \\nfinancing arrangements and the impact of the time value of money. Sales by property developers or construction companies may include financing arrangements in that the timing of cash inflows from the customer may not correspond with the timing of recognition of revenue. Under the new Standard, the financing component, if it is significant, is accounted for separately from revenue. This applies to payments in advance as well as in arrears, but subject to an exemption where the period between payment and transfer of goods or services will be less than one year. This new guidance may change current accounting practices in some cases.  \\nWhat is the impact if a contract is modified?\\nIn the past, IFRSs included only limited guidance on how to account for modifications to a contract. IFRS 15 includes detailed guidance on whether a contract modification should be accounted for prospectively (as an adjustment to future revenues) or retrospectively (via an adjustment when the modification occurs). It is not uncommon for the scope or price of arrangements in the real estate sector to be modified, particularly for construction companies, and therefore these requirements may result in a change of practice for  some entities. Property managers\\nWhen should variable or uncertain revenues be recognised?\\nProperty management contracts often include significant variable elements, such as performance bonuses, rental guarantees, profit sharing arrangements relating to the subsequent sale of real estate, etc. There are new specific requirements in respect of variable consideration such that it is only included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that the amount of revenue recognised would not be subject to significant future reversals as a result of subsequent re-estimation. This approach to variable and contingent consideration is different from that previously reflected in IFRSs and, in certain scenarios, will require a significant degree of judgement to estimate the amount of consideration that should be taken into account. Accordingly, the profile of revenue recognition may change for some entities as a result.\\nWhat else might change?\\nIn addition to the key changes discussed above, the new Standard introduces detailed guidance in many areas regarding the reporting of revenue and entities will need to ensure that they have considered all of these when assessing the extent to which their accounting policy for revenue may need to be amended.\\nGetting started\\nSome effective first steps to consider as you begin to evaluate the implications of the new Standard include:\\n•\\tEvaluating significant revenue streams and key contracts to identify the specific revenue recognition changes required and the specific business units where these changes may have the greatest impact.\\n•\\tAddressing the longer lead-time areas where new calculation engines or revised allocation processes may be required.\\n•\\tEstablishing a granular project plan and roadmap to manage the effort across multiple business units and countries.\\nHow Deloitte can help\\nDeloitte has an experienced team of professionals, both in Canada and globally across the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, who can assist in developing an action plan to help you implement the new revenue recognition standard.\\nThese capabilities include the full breadth of services and competencies needed to help clients address these issues, and would include accounting interpretative assistance, help with process revisions, support in making system changes (including development of system business requirements), tax and  other matters.\\nMore detailed information on the impact of IFRS 15 can be found in Deloitte’s IFRS in Focus publication available from \\nwww.iasplus.com. \\nFurther industry publications are also available here.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/ca-en-audit-ifrs15-realestate.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The innovation \\nin this approach is twofold. First, data is secure inside the \\nperimeter, rather than being another fence around unsecure \\ndata elements. Second, with the blockchain approach, the data \\nand its administrative records are immutable, and tampering is \\ntraceable.11 PQC will likely emerge with capabilities to mitigate risk \\nbased on new, government-approved techniques, coupled with  \\nnovel approaches.12', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Embedding large-scale \\ninsurance and banking products or \\nservices at the point of sale could not only disrupt long -\\ntime distribution channels over the rest of this decade, \\nbut may also result in the creation of an entirely new set \\nof alliances with nonfinancial services partners—many \\nof whom may be unfamiliar with the transactions they \\nare facilitating. \\nThere are already many bullish predictions being circu -\\nlated about the growth potential of embedded insur -\\nance. Forecasts for embedded sales of property and \\ncasualty (P&C) insurance alone by 2030 range from \\nUS$70 billion1 in the United States to US$700 billion \\nglobally.2 Deloitte predicts that if as much as 20% of \\nthe US personal auto market goes the embedded route \\nby 2030, at least US$50 billion in premiums could be \\ndiverted away from the industry’s traditional distribution \\nchannels.\\nEmbedded insurance as a concept is nothing new. For \\nyears, tourists have routinely added travel insurance \\nwhen purchasing airfare, while consumers have added \\nwarranty coverage when buying major appliances. What’s likely to change rapidly is the volume of insurance \\npremiums for major lines built into another type of third-\\nparty transaction, with potentially vast implications for \\nboth legacy providers and intermediaries. Including auto \\nor homeowners’ insurance—with the sale of a vehicle or \\nresidence—for example, would bypass traditional sellers \\nsuch as insurance agents, upend direct-to-consumer sales \\nfrom insurers, or even exclude legacy carriers altogether. \\nOne way to avoid disintermediation is for traditional \\ninsurers to consider collaborating with noninsurance \\nproduct and service providers to integrate the sale of \\ntheir coverages into the initial transaction process. In \\nother words, they can follow the adage: “If you can’t \\nbeat them, join them.”\\nFirst movers may enjoy significant competitive advan -\\ntages in what could quickly become a game of musical \\nchairs.

US personal auto insurers wrote \\nUS$267 billion in premiums in 2022,3 accounting for \\nnearly two-thirds of the personal lines segment and \\none-third of all P&C direct premiums written.4 \\nSuch sales make up the majority of the books of business \\nof many national brand insurers, with 68% of the indus -\\ntry’s auto premiums coming through direct-to-consumer \\nsales or handled by their exclusive agents.5 Independent \\nagents account for 32% of the market, with auto insur -\\nance being their biggest single volume generator, averag -\\ning 18% of their total book of business.6 Embedded sales \\nwould bypass these traditional channels and instead filter \\nvolume through auto dealers and manufacturer websites. \\nIf as much as a fifth of personal auto insurance is \\nembedded in vehicle sales by 2030, the source of many \\nof those premium dollars for carriers may simply be \\nswapped from current distribution outlets to auto deal -\\ners. However, legacy insurers themselves could be left \\nout of the loop if auto manufacturers start up their own \\nembedded underwriting operations.

Will that reflect \\nbadly on the auto manufacturer? • What if the customer buys or already has an addi -\\ntional vehicle from another auto maker?

Ultimately, \\nsuch ecosystem relationships could become a more signif -\\nicant factor than the breadth of an insurer’s products or \\nservices in winning consumer loyalty. \\nThese are just some of the challenges that may surface \\nfor insurers.

To date, the economics of such a shift is \\nnot supported by the differing pricing dynamics in these \\ntwo asset classes. But a variety of developing factors may \\nmake conversions more attractive and feasible for invest -\\nment. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts \\nthat office-to-residential conversions could become prof -\\nitable within the next five years. We estimate that around \\n14,700 affordable units in central business district (CBD) \\nareas across the country can be added by 2030, assuming \\napproximately 20% of converted square footage can be \\nearmarked for affordable housing.\\nEstimates suggest that there is just shy of one billion \\nsquare feet of available office space in search of tenants \\nin the United States,1 nearly 1.5 times the amount from \\nthe end of 2019.2 With a shortage of nearly three million \\nhomes,3 the US housing sector has emerged as a likely \\nrecipient of the unused downtown office space. So far, \\nthe US commercial real estate industry has been slow \\nto respond: Between 2016 and 2021, there were, on \\naverage, 31 housing conversions from office products per \\nyear, totaling 188 projects.4 And while many Americans \\nare still working from home, at least part of the time—a \\ntrend that will likely continue—only 217 conversion \\nprojects  are in the immediate pipeline for completion.5 \\nGovernment and business leaders appear to be taking \\nnotice.6 Some political leaders at the local and state levels have put forward legislation or called for action \\nspecifically supporting office-to-housing initiatives. These \\nactions could provide incentives for real estate developers \\nto provide Americans with clean, affordable, and safe \\nplaces to live. Here are some of the initiatives in the \\nworks so far: \\n• At the end of 2021, Chicago’s La Salle Central \\nTIF district had a balance of US$197 million in \\ntax increment financing that they planned to make \\navailable to developers, with a priority on underuti -\\nlized space. These would include those prime for \\nconversion from commercial to residential space.7\\n• Washington, D.C. launched a US$2.5 million, \\n20-year tax abatement program for owners who \\nadd at least 10 housing units and change a building’s \\nuse in the downtown D.C. area, and of those units, \\n15% must be set aside for affordable housing.8\\n• California set aside US$400 million in incentives for \\noffice-to-affordable-housing conversions. The state \\nalready had more than 50 applicants and roughly \\nUS$105 million already allocated as of early March \\n2023.9\\nCity governments have provided these types of incentives \\nfor conversion projects before. In the early 1990s, New \\nYork City passed the 421-g tax abatement program, \\nincentivizing 13 million square feet of downtown \\nManhattan conversions. And Philadelphia passed its own \\nabatement program in 1997, resulting in 180 building \\nconversions.10', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

We \\nanticipate that, by 2027, shifts \\nin rents, valuations, acquisition costs, and conversion \\ncosts, in addition to added government-backed incen -\\ntives, could allow developers to achieve a net profit on \\nconversions of underutilized office space in favor of resi -\\ndential space (see sidebar for further information).Layout aside, two valuation assumptions could deter \\ndevelopers in the near term: comparable rent and high \\nvacancy. The median asking rent for an apartment unit in \\nthe United States is around US$22 per square foot (psf). \\nWith US office rents still averaging US$37.38 psf,11 a \\n41% pricing concession in addition to an amortized cost \\nof conversion is a tough pill to swallow. Additionally, \\ndevelopers would be unlikely to convert a building with \\na below-average vacancy that is still operating best as \\nan office building.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

This is down \\n6.6% from today’s prices, or a trajectory of –1.4% compounded \\nannually. As hard and soft costs could abate with inflation-\\nreduction efforts over the coming years and added benefits \\nof increased government incentives, potentially offsetting \\nconversion costs by as much at US$55 psf,13 we assume the \\ncost to convert could near US$150 psf on average over the \\nsame time frame, down from US$213 psf at the end of 2021.Offsetting these costs of acquisition and conversion for developers \\nare the anticipated increased implied value of new residential \\nassets upon completion. Assuming continued multifamily rent \\ngrowth and corresponding compressions in cap rates, multifamily \\nassets could trade for approximately US$545 psf in 2027, up from \\nUS$438 psf at the end of 2022. Multifamily properties would \\nneed to sustain a 3% compounded annual growth rate for rents \\nover the next five years to achieve these valuations. Assuming \\nthis valuation growth trajectory, 2027 would be the first year \\nin which revenue from the sale of residential assets could be \\nexpected to offset the costs of acquisition and conversion.\\nOver the years, high conversion costs may have deterred \\ndevelopers from converting underutilized office build -\\nings into affordable residential buildings. However, since \\n2020, several new government-enabled incentives have \\nbeen announced to provide supply-side solutions to help \\naddress both the shortage of affordable housing and the \\nincreasing number of vacant office spaces. Several regions \\nare making progress in developing tax policies that will \\nmake these conversion projects feasible, with several \\ndevelopers already moving at the opportunity:\\n• 25 Water Street, New York City. The biggest \\nconversion project in the country to date will trans -\\nform a former office building into 1,300 new apart -\\nments over the next two years.14 The building was \\npurchased in December 2022 for US$250 million, \\nand the developers closed on a US$536 million loan \\nto finance the redevelopment.15\\n• One Wall Street, New York City.  This conversion \\nwas completed in February 2023. The 1.25 million \\nsquare foot building now holds 500 housing units \\nthat have recently gone up for sale.16• 4750 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles.  Construction \\nstarted earlier this year to turn the former 144,300 \\nsquare foot building into a mixed-use opportu -\\nnity. The plan is to convert the top two floors into \\n68 housing units while retaining 30,000 square \\nfeet on the ground floor for continued office use. \\nDevelopers also plan to add amenities such as fitness \\ncenters and pools.17\\nA combination of some of the benefits provided by local \\ngovernments can make the math work for conversions \\nat scale. In particular, government incentive programs \\ncan help make conversions more feasible by easing \\nrestrictions around zoning and density, providing direct \\nfinancial subsidies and tax abatements, and waiving off \\nor redistributing infrastructure upgrade costs to a longer \\ntime horizon.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

Deloitte predicts consumer \\npurchases of carbon offsets will become pervasive \\nand grow into a nearly US$100 billion market in  \\ndeveloped economies by 2030.1 \\nDeloitte expects new carbon-trading networks to emerge \\nthat cater to the heightened demand for tailored, local -\\nized, and niche actions to help mitigate climate change. \\nThere is already a growing appetite for products that \\nhave a sustainability label; roughly two-thirds of US \\nconsumers say they would pay more at the pump for \\ngas that offsets its greenhouse gas emissions.2 Moreover, \\nan international survey conducted by Shopify last year \\nfound that two-fifths of consumers say they would pay a \\nhigher price for climate-focused products.3 Demand for \\noffsetting will likely only grow as younger people, who \\noften voice a preference for sustainable products,4 gain \\npurchasing power. \\nSeveral categories of consumer spending, including food, \\ntransportation, and entertainment, could easily incorpo -\\nrate an option to purchase carbon offsets. We estimate \\nthat a small percentage of these expenditures will include \\na supplemental offset, leading Americans to spend $21.3 \\nbillion a year to mitigate the environmental impact of \\ntheir purchases by 2030, adjusting for expected inflation. \\nIf these habits are mirrored in other developed econo -\\nmies, then global consumers in developed economies will \\ncollectively pay nearly $100 billion to offset goods and \\nservices at decade’s end.5 \\n \\nWhile there may be those who reject environment, social, \\nand governance principles, the majority of Americans \\nremain concerned about the carbon footprint of the items \\nthey buy.6 Despite the surge of inflation in 2022, the \\nmarket for sustainable products accounted for 17.3% \\nof purchases in the United States last year, according \\nto Circana and the New York University Stern Center \\nfor Sustainable Business.7 These products experienced a five-year compound annual growth rate of 9.48%—\\nnearly double that of conventionally marketed prod -\\nucts—and consumer behaviorists do not expect those \\npreferences to wane.8 \\nCarbon offsetting is becoming more common in the \\ntravel and tourism industry. Tour operators such as \\nWorld Expeditions, Bamboo Travel, and Intrepid \\npurchase offsets to neutralize the impact of their consum -\\ners’ trips.9 Stand-alone organizations that offer travelers \\ncarbon calculators and the option to offset activities are \\ngaining in popularity as well. Cool Effect, for example, \\nhas retired five million tons of carbon emissions and \\ngenerated US$36 million for emerging countries since it \\nlaunched in 2016.10\\nIn addition, more than 50 global airlines now offer \\ncarbon offsetting to passengers, 11 and some carriers \\nreward loyalty points to customers who purchase carbon-\\ncredit units when booking their flights.12 Hotels are also \\nbeginning to offer carbon-neutral packages to guests,13 \\nand large employers, such as HSBC, are incorporating \\noffsets into their low-carbon policies for business travel.14 \\nAfter making more informed decisions about conferences \\nand flights, some companies may purchase offsets when \\nthey exceed their “carbon budget” allotments.15\\nOther industries are encouraging consumers to make \\nsustainable choices as well. The American tea company, \\nHarney & Sons, reports that one out of four customers \\nchoose to offset their transactions, which usually equates \\nto 2%–3% of the purchase cost.16\\nSeveral startups have also developed application \\nprogramming interface (API) software—a code that \\nmakes it possible for applications to communicate—\\nbridging apps, devices, and services to shared back-end \\nsystems. These APIs can link carbon-offset crediting to \\nweb and mobile platforms, so businesses can quickly \\nembed a widget that will calculate an order’s emissions \\nand offer users the ability to offset it.

Similarly, outdoor \\nmusic venues can extend the option to buy carbon credits \\nthat fund conservation efforts in the countries where the \\nperforming artists are from.\\nOver time, the momentum for these carbon transac -\\ntions can spur local economies.

Cities and regions could also launch campaigns \\nthat link ticket sales for popular events such as sports \\ngames with biodiversity projects that repair local habi -\\ntats. Research universities can help execute these projects \\nor verify their benefits to the region. When consumers \\nbegin to see the benefits of their investments in their own \\nneighborhoods and backyards, their trust in the carbon- \\noffset market should grow. \\nFinancial institutions could also enable carbon-credit \\nfinancing to happen behind the scenes. For example, \\nembedded insurance tools such as telematics apps may reward safe driving behaviors with carbon credits that \\noffset the car’s emissions. Other fintech-enabled trans -\\nactions, such as food delivery or ride-sharing platforms, \\nmay offer a premium tier with environmental benefits. \\nSweden’s Braathens Regional Airlines has been market -\\ning this concept in Europe with its “Green Class” ticket \\nthat costs about US$30 extra but adds more biofuel \\nto the passenger’s trip and invests in carbon-reduction \\nprojects.22 Many US consumers would think highly of \\nsuch a service, according to a 2016 study from the United \\nStates Department of Energy. About 75% of surveyed \\nUber riders say they would push a “Go Green!” button \\nand pay a minimum of US$5.95 to offset a 10-mile trip \\nat least once.23 \\nBanks may also offer tailored carbon credit options \\nin digital wallets based on consumers’ most frequent \\npurchases. Individuals may choose to buy carbon cred -\\nits in advance, especially if they have a lot of travel or \\nemission-intensive activities planned. They could also \\ngift them to environmentally conscious friends and \\nfamily. Some tech companies have begun partnering \\nwith payment platforms to allow customers to exchange \\nrewards points for carbon credits.

Organizations that are unable to lever -\\nage alternative data’s full potential could operate at an \\ninformation disadvantage, which could put them at risk \\nof falling behind their peers in their quest for growth in \\nassets under management. \\nAlternative data has become much more accessible to \\ninvestment management firms since many companies \\nacross industries have started to clean, package, and \\nsell “exhaust data”—data generated at various points \\nin their supply chain—to create an additional income \\nstream.3 In fact, the number of alternative data sets \\napplicable to financial services increased by ~36% over \\nthe last two years and the number of alternative-data \\nproviders increased by ~29% over the same period.4 So \\norganizations that make investment decisions without \\nincorporating inputs from these alternative data sets \\ncould leave out more information than they include in \\ntheir investment decisions.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n",

Plugging deposit outflows was a dominant \\nconcern for multiple regional banks. And, despite stron -\\nger-than-expected earnings in the first quarter of 2023 \\nand extraordinary support from regulators,2 the trials \\nseem far from over—at least for the subset of banks  \\nin question.\\nEven as fears around banks’ stability seems to have \\nsubsided and overall deposit outflows have declined,3 \\ncustomer demand for higher deposit rates is expected \\nto remain elevated, possibly for a long time. In fact, \\nrecent Deloitte research shows that savings intentions \\nhave become stronger, suggesting consumers are focused \\non replenishing depleted savings.4  \\nAfter years of near-zero deposit rates, many banks were \\ncompelled to offer higher rates as the recent fed funds \\nrate hike cycle kicked in. Clearly, the era of cheap depos -\\nits had come to an end. For instance, the cost of inter -\\nest-bearing deposits (including certificates of deposit, \\nmoney market deposit accounts, and savings deposits) \\nrose by 73 basis points (bps) to 0.99% by the end of \\n2022, up from 0.26%, a year ago.5 This rise translated \\ninto higher deposit betas—i.e., the proportion of change in the federal funds rate that is passed on to customers.6 \\nThis trend only accelerated in Q1 2023, when the goal \\nof retaining deposits was paramount. Of the top 30 US \\nbanks, almost half had cumulative deposit betas higher \\nthan the previous rate hike cycle in 2015–19.7\\nMarket consensus points to a pause and/or drop in the \\nfed funds rate once the surge in inflation reverses and/\\nor the economy goes into a downturn. Given these \\nexpectations, the Federal Open Market Committee \\nprojects the fed funds rate to decline to 4.3 and 3.1 \\nin 2024 and 2025, respectively, from a high of 5.1 in \\n2023.8 Inflation appears to be slowing down already; \\nit dropped to 4.9% in April 2023—the first time it \\ndipped below 5% in two years.9  \\nIn a rising rate environment, deposit rates tend to be \\nmore “sticky”; they generally grow more slowly because \\nbanks are reluctant to pass on higher federal funds rates \\nto their customers. In a falling rate environment, deposit \\nrates are more “flexible” with banks looking to drop \\nrates.10 As such, rates are typically “downwards-flexible \\nand upwards-sticky,”11 making their relationship asym -\\nmetric. However, in some ways, the next two years could \\ndefy this principle. \\nIn fact, the Deloitte Center for Financial Services esti -\\nmates the average cost of interest-bearing deposits in \\n2024 and 2025 will remain at 1.7% and 1.5%, respec -\\ntively, even if Fed funds’ rates drop (figure 1).12 This will \\nresult in lower deposit betas even as the Fed fund rate \\ncomes down from the recent peak, a historical anomaly. \\nAs stated above, one would expect deposit betas to be \\nmuch higher in a downward-sloping rate environment.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",

The \\nlimited pool of available cash could \\nsee increased competition from banks \\nof all sizes, money market funds and T-bills, and \\nalso fintechs and nonbanks. Digital-only banks, for \\ninstance, will likely continue to offer higher Certificate \\nof Deposit (CD) rates; they are also offering varia -\\ntions on typical features such as a CD with no early  \\nwithdrawal penalty.18 \\nSeveral banks have also hiked rates and extended new \\nmarketing campaigns.19 Financial institutions, such as \\nCapital One, Citigroup, and Synchrony, for example, are \\nmarketing one-year CDs with rates in excess of 4%.20 \\nYet, responses vary across the industry. The average \\ndeposit beta for top US banks in the current hike cycle \\nas of Q1 2023 stands at 41%, 600 bps lower than the \\nlast cycle’s peak deposit beta in 2015–19, despite current \\nrate hikes already far beyond the last period’s peak. The \\ncumulative deposit beta differed from 69% to 19%—a \\nsubstantial range.21\\nThe type and stickiness of deposits in banks’ portfolios \\ncan also play an important role. Many banks with a \\nportfolio skewed toward retail deposits have enjoyed \\na softer cushion when compared to commercial depos -\\nits. In fact, among the top 30 banks, those with strong \\nretail deposit portfolios had an average deposit beta \\nof 34% compared to 45% for banks with strong  commercial deposits.22 \\nBanks should expect changes and new applications of \\nsupervisory tools and regulatory frameworks. These \\nmay include: Modification of the tailoring rules imple -\\nmented in 2019 that reduced compliance requirements \\nfor smaller and less complex banks; recalibration of \\nthresholds for capital and liquidity; and potential new \\nCCAR scenarios, including more severe stress testing \\nassumptions for liquidity. There could possibly be higher \\ndeposit insurance fund (DIF) fees, and reevaluation of \\nassumptions about deposit stickiness by supervisors and \\nbanks alike, and how these factor into modeling. There \\ncould also be sharper scrutiny by examiners on safety \\nand soundness. \\nAnother new and notable item is how recent bank deposit \\nruns were “fueled” by social media.23 Regulators have \\nwarned banks about the perils of social media–driven \\ninformation flows. This has added a new dimension to \\nhow banks manage their exposure across multiple risk \\nstripes, including liquidity, operational, and reputation. \\nThese additional changes to current regulations and \\nsupervisory practices should increase the funding pres -\\nsure on banks that are not already facing the severest \\nregulatory constraints.

Transitioning to real-time payments, \\ntherefore, may not be a panacea for all challenges, but \\nit should help address some.

Thus, there is a strong imperative for \\ngrowth of autonomous driving technologies to \\noffset the anticipated shortage of human drivers.  In addition to helping alleviate the driver shortage, \\nautonomous trucks could be more efficient than those \\ndriven by humans. Regulations permit live operators \\nto drive a maximum of 11 hours daily, although an \\naverage driver spends only 6 to 6.5 hours behind the \\nwheel. Self-driving trucks can let companies triple the \\ndriving time to 17 hours daily.7 Various studies claim \\nautonomous trucks to be more fuel-efficient as well.8  \\nThe pandemic highlighted the importance of \\nresilient supply chains for the economy. A recent \\nDeloitte survey of US and Europe transportation \\nproviders and manufacturers revealed that 51% \\nare actively adopting autonomous vehicles \\nfor fleet transportation to help alleviate  \\nsupply chain challenges or improve supply chain \\noperations.9 The promise of autonomous trucks \\nalso led investors to heavily increase funding. \\nAccording to PitchBook data, venture capital \\ninvested in autonomous trucking grew almost tenfold in 2020 to US$3.7 billion, followed by a nearly \\nidentical sum in 2021.

Many \\nfraudsters concoct entire personas using a mix of real and \\nfabricated information, which are often pinned to social security numbers taken from children or the recently \\ndeceased. These bad actors may spend months or years \\nnurturing their synthetic identities, and more than half \\nhave a credit score over 650,5 just shy of what agencies \\nconsider “good.”6 The average payoff is estimated to be \\nbetween US$81,000 and US$98,000,7 but a single attack \\ncan sometimes result in the theft of several millions.8 \\nSynthetic fraudsters may also try to disguise themselves \\nas new customers so they can add themselves to exist -\\ning bank accounts, or look for lenders who will grant \\nloans to “credit invisible” consumers with no reportable \\nfinancial history.9 \\nWhat makes synthetic identity fraud notoriously difficult \\nto detect? For a start, fraudsters often create an exten -\\nsive history in the public domain using their fabricated \\ncredentials. They can also correctly enter information \\nto common identity verification questions about their \\nmanufactured lives. In fact, 85% of synthetic identities \\nin the emerging consumer sector elude third-party risk \\nmodels, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions.10 These \\nexternal tools will be increasingly useful for detecting \\nanomalous behavior and reducing false positive rates, \\nespecially if they utilize deep learning to analyze multiple \\ncharacteristics and data points of users’ identities at once. \\nBanks and financial institutions should follow rigorous \\nmodel risk management procedures to help ensure they \\nare properly monitoring algorithms for performance, \\ntransparency, and interpretability.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

Unlike passwords or PINs, \\nphysical biometric technology can analyze traits that \\nare unique to each consumer’s makeup, such as their \\npalm vein patterns, retina details, vocal pitch, and ear \\ncanal shapes. These biometric security tools can improve \\noutcomes for ID verification and authentication, but \\nmany emerging solutions are susceptible to low-cost, \\ncreative workarounds. Researchers, for example, recently \\nhacked facial identification technology by placing glasses \\nwith tape where eyes should be over smartphones \\nowners’ faces while they slept.11 Smartphone users \\nhave also found a myriad of ways to dupe fingerprint \\nsensors, including with gummy bears,12 wood glue,13 \\nand cheap printed circuit boards.14 These “deepfakes” \\nhave passed through some banks’ know your customer \\n(KYC) protocols.15\\nTo help counteract these fraudulent actions, new and \\npowerful biometric tools can provide additional layers of \\ndefense by evaluating whether users are human, testing \\nthe veracity of visual artifacts and manipulated record -\\nings, and identifying anomalies that may be atypical of \\nonline consumer behavior. These loopholes may create \\nmore demand for biometrics capabilities that can assess \\n“liveness.” \\nFinancial institutions should expend more effort refin -\\ning “liveness detection” checks that distinguish human \\nconsumers from synthetic identities who use stolen or \\nAI-generated content to act as the face of their alter egos. \\nThese tests may use a range of techniques to verify that a user is responding in real time, for example, by asking \\nthem to tilt their head to the side, smile, or blink. Security \\nsystems for physical biometrics can compete with the \\ngrowing sophistication of spoofers by adding elements \\nlike skin texture, facial imperfections, perspiration, and \\nblood flow.16 Banks and card issuers can then evaluate \\nwhether the results match up with government-issued ID \\ndocuments, as well as third-party consortium data and \\nany national ID verification services available to them. \\nThey can also check for other indicators of synthetic \\nidentity fraud, such as a lack of connections to family \\nmembers and associates.17 \\nBanks and card issuers are also planning to significantly \\nexpand capabilities in emerging behavioral biometrics \\ntools. These systems can provide continuous authen -\\ntication by tracking dynamic information about users \\nand learning more about them over time. Moreover, this \\ninformation can usually be gathered with no additional \\ninput from consumers, and it is nearly impossible to \\nreplicate. For example, behavioral biometrics technolo -\\ngies aim to analyze a consumer’s touchscreen behavior, \\nmobile app navigation, and typing habits. As a result, \\neven if cyber criminals had the correct password for the \\nuser they’re trying to impersonate, the technology could \\nflag that they’re entering a password slower than usual \\nor applying less pressure to the device’s screen. \\nBehavioral biometrics is expected to be particularly \\neffective in spotting synthetic identities, since fraud -\\nsters usually type information quickly across multiple \\nforms, copy and paste it from other sources, or use \\nuncommon keyboard shortcuts.18 The test results can \\nthen be supplemented with nonbiometric factors, such \\nas location histories and spending habits, to trigger \\ninstant alerts of unusual transactions that require further', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

For example, financial institutions \\nmay need to develop interactive dashboards that may \\nlink behavioral biometric systems to new tools for flag -\\nging one-time password fraud, SIM swap fraud, and \\nmobile wallet fraud in real time.

Robo-\\nadvisory—delivering automated advice with minimal \\nhuman intervention needed—could be a cost-effective \\nand scalable solution to provide advice to clients who \\nhave smaller portfolios. \\nIn the past, financial organizations that deployed \\nrobo-advisers found it difficult to target potential clients \\noutside of those in the high net wealth segment because \\nproviding holistic financial advice in a direct-to-consumer \\nmodel was very expensive.13 Also, it could take as long as \\na decade for financial services firms using robo-advisers \\nto recoup their customer acquisition costs.14 But the tech -\\nnology driving robo-advisers has evolved considerably \\nsince robo-advisory first appeared when the advice was \\nmainly limited to suggesting potential exchange-traded \\nfunds for investment based on the answers to online \\nquestionnaires.15Robo-advisers are shifting from algorithm-based port -\\nfolio adjustments that use predefined sets of rules to \\nfully automated investments fueled by self-learning arti -\\nficial intelligence algorithms and automatic asset shifts.16 \\nAI-powered robo-advisers can provide end-to-end, real-\\ntime, personalized investment solutions (e.g., portfolio \\nselection, automatic rebalancing, and tax loss harvesting) \\nbased on a client’s investment goals and risk profile to \\ndeliver recommendations in an interactive, conversa -\\ntional format with lower incremental client servicing \\ncosts than human advisers. \\nRegardless the amount of human interaction, financial \\nservices firms should continue to prioritize addressing \\nregulatory requirements, such as those surrounding fidu -\\nciary duty. In the United States, the SEC offers guidance \\nfor robo-advisers surrounding the presentation of disclo -\\nsures, ongoing client suitability of advice, and effective \\ninternal compliance programs.17 As more client services \\nare driven through robo-advisory platforms, corre -\\nsponding increases in client protection should follow. \\nApart from adhering to regulatory requirements such \\nas conducting an annual review of the written policies \\nand procedures enacted to prevent violations of the \\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940, robo-advisers should \\nalso consider instituting procedures surrounding aspects \\nthat pertain to their operating model. For example, \\nrobo-advisers should consider policies and procedures \\nfor testing and monitoring the algorithmic code, as well \\nas adequate oversight of any third party which may have \\nbeen involved in the development of the code.18\\nAside from the technological advancements that are \\nhelping pave the way for more comprehensive auto -\\nmated financial advice at a lower cost, it may also be \\nmore cost-effective to reach new clients than previously', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n",

One way financial advisory firms can \\nminimize customer acquisitions costs could be \\nby capitalizing on these potential clients who are \\nalready familiar and participating in the growing \\nmobile wallet market. Rather than building a plat -\\nform from the ground up, there may be opportuni -\\nties to form partnerships with established mobile wallet platforms to tap into an existing user base. \\nThe partnership could involve an all-in-one type of \\nplatform where the mobile wallet and robo-advi -\\nsory accounts share the same platform, or the user \\ncould be directed through the mobile wallet to open \\na robo-advisory account on a robo-specific platform.\\nRobo-advice for all \\nAccording to a recent survey, 75% \\nof millennial respondents were \\nopen to using a robo-advisor to \\nmanage investments.19 This may \\nbe ascribed to limited investment \\nknowledge or the desire to actively \\nmanage a portfolio. On the other hand, only 43% of \\nbaby boomers surveyed said they were interested in \\nusing robo-adviser platforms, perhaps because they \\neither lack trust in financial advice algorithms, or \\nthey prefer a more hands-on approach to choosing \\ntheir investments.20 \\nBut robo-advisers can only truly be inclusive if they \\nserve people of all ages. Older clients may prefer \\nhybrid robo-adviser platforms. These combine automated advice and human financial advisors, \\nwho are available via phone or video. While slightly \\nmore expensive than purely automated advice, \\nvirtual access to a human advisor can help alleviate \\ntrust-related concerns and build credibility over time. \\nWith an almost US$22 trillion in estimated invest -\\nable assets by 2030, the global mass retail market \\nmay be too great of an opportunity to pass over for \\nmuch longer. Should financial services institutions \\nsucceed in making financial advice more accessible, \\npeople who may have previously turned to social \\nmedia for advice could seek out the industry’s vast \\nknowledge and expertise. Ultimately, financial \\nservices players can play a large role in making \\nsociety more equitable, profitably.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/POVs/Sabrina/DI_FSI-Predictions-2023.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",
